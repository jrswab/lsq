# lsq

A command-line tool for rapid journal entry creation in Logseq, featuring both TUI and external editor support.

## Features
- External editor integration ($EDITOR by default)
- Terminal User Interface (TUI) with real-time editing
- Automatic journal file creation
- Support for both Markdown and Org formats
- Configurable file naming format
- Customizable Logseq directory location

### TUI Specific Features
- File search functionality with prefix matching
- TODO & priority cycling through keyboard shortcuts
- Line indentation & unindentation
- Auto-save when switching files through search

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/jrswab/lsq@latest
```

## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
lsq
```

This opens today's journal in your default editor ($EDITOR environment variable).
If no editor is defined in $EDITOR then `Vim` is will be used.

### Command Line Options

- `-a`: Append text directly to the current journal page
- `-c`: Specify config filename. (default: "config.edn")
- `-d`: Specify Logseq directory path. (default: "~/Logseq", expample: "/home/jaron/Document/Notes" you can also used "~/" instead of full home path.)
- `-e`: Set editor to use while editing files. (If the flag is not provided `$EDITOR` is used. If `$EDITOR` is not set, Vim is used.)
- `-f`: Search pages and aliases. Must be followed by a string.
- `-l`: Specify Logseq config directory name. (default: "logseq")
- `-o`: Automatically open the first result from the search.
- `-p`: Open a specific page from the Logseq pages directory.
- `-s`: Specify the journal date to open. (Must be `yyy-MM-dd` formatted)
~~- `-t`: Use the built-in TUI instead of external editor.~~

## TUI (Deprecated)
As lsq moves toward v1.0.0, I've decided to focus on perfecting the core CLI experience. The TUI interface is now deprecated in favor of enhanced external editor integration and improved command-line workflows. This aligns with the project goal of providing the fastest, most reliable journaling experience possible. While the TUI was fast and operated well, it's outside of the current scope of this project. However, this does not mean that TUI is gone forever and if the community wants a TUI after v1.0.0 is released, I'd be happy to work on it again.

### TUI Controls (Deprecated)

~~- `Ctrl+S`: Save current file~~
~~- `Ctrl+C`: Quit~~
~~- `Ctrl+T`: Cycle through TODO states on current line~~
~~- `Ctrl+P`: Cycle through priority states on current line~~
~~- `Ctrl+F`: Open search modal~~
~~- `tab`: Indent the entire line from anywhere on the line.~~
~~- `shift+tab`: Unindent the line from anywhere on te line.~~
~~- Arrow keys: Navigate through text~~

### TUI Search Modal Controls (Deprecated)

~~- Type to search through files~~
~~- `â†‘/â†“`: Navigate through results~~
~~- `Enter`: Open selected file (current files saves on open)~~
~~- `Esc`: Close search modal~~

## Configuration

LSQ reads your Logseq configuration from `config.edn`. Supported settings:

- `meta/version`: Configuration version
- `preferred-format`: File format ("Markdown" or "Org")
- `journal/file-name-format`: Date format for journal files (e.g., "yyyy_MM_dd")
